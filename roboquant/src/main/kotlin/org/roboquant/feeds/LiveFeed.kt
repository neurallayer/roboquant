/**
 * Live feed represents a feed of live data. So data that comes in as it is observed with timestamps
 * close to the present. Since a live feed has no pre-defined end, it will continue to run unless you specify
 * a timeframe during the run.
 *
 * This default implementation generates heartbeat signals to ensure components still have an opportunity
 * to act even if no other data is incoming. A heartbeat is an [empty event][org.roboquant.common.Event.empty].
 *
 * Changing this value during the play of a feed will not impact the interval of the first coming heartbeat.
