/**
 * SignalStrategy that uses the crossover of two Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) to generate a BUY or SELL signal. It is
 * frequently used in FOREX trading, but can also be applied to other asset classes.
 *
 * The rules are straight forward:
 *
 * - If the fast EMA trend crosses over the slow EMA trend, generate a BUY signal
 * - If the fast EMA trend crosses under the slow EMA trend, generate a SELL signal
 * - Don't generate a signal in all other scenarios
 *
 * This is a computational and memory efficient implementation since it doesn't store historic prices in memory.
 *
 * @constructor Create a new EMACrossover strategy
 *
 * @param fastPeriod The shorter (fast) period or fast EMA in number of events, default is 12
 * @param slowPeriod The longer (slow) period or slow EMA in number of events, default is 26
 * @param smoothing The smoothing factor to use, default is 2.0
 * @property minEvents minimal number of events observed before starting to execute the strategy, default is the same
 * @property priceType the type of price to use, like "CLOSE" or "OPEN", default is "DEFAULT"
 * as the slow period
