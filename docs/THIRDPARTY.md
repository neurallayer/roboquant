# Third Party Open Source

_Roboquant_ couldn’t have been developed without the use of free and open source third party software. This document lists some great open software libraries and other artifacts used in roboquant.

## Software
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org): modern, concise and safe programming language that makes writing code a joy.
* [TA-Lib](https://ta-lib.org): an extensive and fast library of technical indicators.
* [ECharts-Java](https://github.com/ECharts-Java/ECharts-Java): a Java library that makes it easy to create [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org) visualizations.
* [Avro](https://avro.apache.org): data serialization system for fast and efficient storage of data.
* [Hipparchus](https://www.hipparchus.org/index.html): a library of lightweight, self-contained mathematics and statistics components.
* [Jupyter](https://www.jupyter.org): the standard for interactive development and perhaps best known in combination with Python and R. But it also works like a charm with Kotlin.
* [FastCSV](https://github.com/osiegmar/FastCSV): an ultra-fast and easy to use CSV parser.

## Other artifacts
* `Comfortaa` font created by Johan Aakerlund. I really like how _roboquant_ looks like using `Comfortaa` font.
* Modified robot image from Free Vector Characters, as also seen on the README page and [roboquant.org](https://roboquant.org) website.
